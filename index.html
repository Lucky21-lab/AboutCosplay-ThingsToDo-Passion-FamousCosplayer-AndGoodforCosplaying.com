    <h1>WHAT IS COSPLAY?</h1>
    <hr>
    <h4>Cosplay is not about you wearing outfits to get attention and get a picture with a stranger; cosplay is about fashion; it's about how you can make your 
        <br>
        confidence higher; and it can also help you face someone you are afraid to talk to; it can also help you gain more connection with them. You will also meet a  
        <br>
        stranger that turns into a friendship. This is also a hobby that can make you happy because it's fun and enjoyable. There are more events and more people   
        <br>
        you can talk to, and lastly, it will help you get to know the people that you want to be their friends. You can also join their group, even though you're still not   
        <br>
        close to them. They are good at communication, so you don't have to worry, and you can also upgrade your skills so you'll not be shy next time.</h4>

    <h1>ONE OF THE EXAMPLE OF A COSPLAY EVENT</h1>

    <img src="cosplay-matsuri-2023.jpg">
    <h4>Anime Corner was invited to join all 3 days of Cosplay Matsuri on December 28-30, 2024. Lucky De Guzman, one of my fellow writers, also accompanied me
        <br>in my coverage for the event, so I thought it would be fun to share her point of view since this is her first anime convention ever in the Philippines. 
        Cosplay 
        <br>Matsuri marks the finale of the Cosplay Mania 2023 series by Cosplay.ph.</h4>
        <h4><p>1. <mark>TeAr Aesthetic Haute</mark> â€“ a booth that kikay girls would love! It offered different low-cost ready-made earrings and coasters. They also had hair accessories 
            <br>and anime plushies available! Itâ€™s good to see products (other than anime merchandise) available at the convention.</p>

        <h4><p>2. <mark>DGSJ TOYS x CROWâ€™S NEST</mark> â€“ a booth for toy collectors as they were selling a variety of official figures and plushies. 
            <br>(They were challenging to find because plushies covered the shop name.)</p>

        <h4><p>3. <mark>Miki-San</mark> â€“ another booth meant to satisfy a collectorâ€™s hobby!</p>

        <h4><p>4. <mark>KYG Shop</mark> â€“ a booth that also had anime merchandise and some K-pop posters.</p>

        <h4><p>5. <mark>Kaiju Geijutsu</mark> â€“ for the One Piece fans and figure collectors out there.</p>

        <h4><p>6. <mark>Minty Jade Studio</mark> â€“ they had chibi anime keychains, tote bags, lanyards, and mousepads. Also some cute hair accessories.</p>

        <h4><p>7. <mark>Hubbyte Toy Store</mark> â€“ one of the bigger booths that had a variety of official anime merchandise. They also had blind boxes and gachapons, which can be 
            <br>played for a minimum of about 200 PHP (~12 USD) per pull. You have to be really lucky to get the character you like.</p>

        <h4><p>8. <mark>The VOLS Project Booth</mark> â€“ a booth introducing Filipino VTubers. I look forward to seeing their growth.</p>

        <h4><p>9. <mark>Gamdias Philippines Booth</mark> â€“ a booth for gamers! They had their gaming gear set up for con-goers to try by playing Tekken.</p>

        <h4><p>10. <mark>Aniporium</mark> â€“ another one for the anime collectors with a variety of figures and gachapons available.</p>

    <h2>Is cosplay just to get some attention because of the costume?   </h2>

                    <h4><p>Cosplay is not just about donning the costume; itâ€™s about embodying the character. And when youâ€™ve painstakingly put together every detail of your outfit. 
                        <br>Thatâ€™s where the power of posing can make a world of difference. Posing can express your characterâ€™s personality, emphasize the details in your costume, 
                        <br>and take your cosplay to the next level. Getting into character isnâ€™t always intuitive, though, and striking the right pose might feel awkward at first. 
                        <br>Should your feet be shoulder-width apart, or should you lunge forward like a superhero? Sometimes, itâ€™s about creating a recognizable silhouette that 
                        <br>reflects your characterâ€™s essence. Whether youâ€™re brand new to the scene or a seasoned cosplayer, learning how to position your body and use your 
                        <br>surroundings can transform a good photo into a great one. I also recommend looking at other cosplayers. Find photos that you love and figure out how the 
                        <br>cosplayer is posing and why the pose works. Then get in front of a mirror and practice. Youâ€™ll be surprised at how quickly your modeling skills can 
                        <br>improve when youâ€™ve taken the time to observe yourself. Posing for cosplay is a skill that requires practice, youâ€™ll improve with time, but these tips will 
                        <br>help you get started. Think about how your character stands, moves, and interacts with the world. Do they have a signature stance or an iconic gesture? By 
                        <br>learning the nuances of cosplay photography and posing, youâ€™ll not only capture stunning photos but also connect more deeply with your character. It takes 
                        <br>practice, some creativity, and a bit of confidence, but once you nail that perfect pose, the satisfaction is unbeatable. Now, letâ€™s step in front of the lens and 
                        <br>make your cosplay come alive.If you want to see more picturesðŸ‘‰</p></h4>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Supply Checklist for Beginner Cosplayers</h2>
    <h4><p>1. <mark>Basic prop-making materials</mark> - You can create props from so many different materials. What you use will depend on what you need to make and what kind
        <br> of material you have experience with. Some of the base materials used for cosplay props include: PVC pipesÂ or wooden dowels EVA foamÂ or craft foam 
        <br>(more information on how to use EVA foam for beginners)
        <br>
        <br>Paper clay
        <br>Worbla
        <br>Cardboard
        <br>Styrofoam
        <br>
        <br>Inevitably, there will come a time when you need to experiment with something new. When you do, always get more of the material than you think youâ€™ll need. 
        <br>Not only will this cover mistakes that you will definitely make, but it also means youâ€™ll have leftover material to add to your supplies closet for future use.</p>
        
        <h4><p>2.  <mark>Adhesive (glue!)</mark> - Whatever project you are working on, you are going to need some heavy-duty adhesive to put it all together. The three types of glue you 
            <br>always want to have on hand are:
        <br>
        <br>Contact cement
        <br>Hot glue
        <br>Superglue
        <br>
        <br>The type you use will depend on the materials youâ€™re using. I use hot glue as my first choice since this is the non-toxic option (always use contact cement 
        <br>and superglue in a well-ventilated area). However, hot glue does not have as strong a hold and itâ€™s likely to fall apart when if youâ€™re using it with a prop 
        <br>you are heat-shaping (such as EVA foam).
        <br>
        <br>Duct tape, masking tape, and packing tape are also good to have around if you can cover them up. The problem with tape is that paint doesnâ€™t adhere to it 
        <br>very well, so youâ€™ll end up with an uneven paint job if you mainly use tape to hold your prop together.
        <br>
        <br>3.Â <mark>Paint and brushes</mark> - I cannot tell you the number of different paints that I have stored away in my cosplay supply closet. You, of course, will end up 
        <br>accumulating many different colors, including shiny and metallic paints.Â 
        
        The ones you always want available, however, are black, white, red, blue, and yellow. 
        <br>With these five colors, you can make just about any other color in the rainbow. So, if you find you forgot to get a color for a specific part of your prop, you 
        <br>can simply mix the paints you have available.
        <br>
        <br>When it comes to paintbrushes, you want to get as many sizes as you can find. You want tiny brushes to work at the little details and patterns, and large sizes 
        <br>to cover large areas with paint and finish quickly. Donâ€™t get the cheapest set you can find. The bristles in these tend to be stiff and even fall off, so you 
        <br>donâ€™t get a very smooth finish. You donâ€™t have to get a professional set, but expect to spend more than ten bucks.
        <br>
        <br>4. <mark>Primer and finishing paint</mark> - Before you start painting a prop, you want to include one or two layers of primer. This is a transparent layer that seals the 
        <br>material below it, preventing the paint from bleeding into the prop. It means you wonâ€™t need to use as many layers of paint.
        <br>
        <br>The most common brand of primer that can be used with almost any material is calledÂ Mod Podge. This brand can also be used as a finishing layer to seal the
        <br> paint below it and prevent it from chipping. You can get a version of Mod Podge with a matte finish or a shiny finish, depending on what your project requires, 
        <br>but I always keep some of this around and use it for just about every prop I make.
        <br>
        <br>5.Â <mark>RazorsÂ andÂ sharpeners</mark> - Whether youâ€™re using a box cutter or a pocket knife, youâ€™ll definitely want some kind of cutting tool. Scissors just arenâ€™t good 
        <br>enough. I recommend getting a few different sizes to work with. Larger razors for general cutting, and small razors for precision cuts and some engraving.
        <br>
        <br>Along with the razors, I highly recommend you keep a sharpener on hand. This will make your cuts cleaner and your props looking better, but it will also help
        <br>in preventing injury. I use a regular old kitchen knife sharpener for this, but you can also use something like a sharpening stone or other cool blade-sharpening 
        <br>gadgets.
        <br>
        <br>6. <mark>Patterns</mark> - Believe it or not, you can use patterns for props the same way you can use patterns for sewing projects. Usually, these will be digitally 
        <br>downloadable, so you can print out the pieces and assemble your cosplay prop. Most often youâ€™ll use patterns with EVA foam to make complicated armor 
        <br>pieces, but you can also find patterns that other cosplayers have made for staffs, swords, bows, etc. of popular characters.
        <br>
        <br>A good place to start looking for your pattern isÂ Kamui Cosplay. They have a lot of different types of patterns to get you started, but you can also search 
        <br>around the cosplay community to find other people who are selling patterns for props theyâ€™ve made in the past.
        <br>
        <br>7. <mark>Safety gear</mark> - (goggles,Â work gloves, etc.) Always make sure to keep safety in mind when you are working on a cosplay. Pay attention to the safety 
        <br>instructions of any materials youâ€™re using. This means using a respirator mask, around any material that might be toxic (cement glue and some paints) 
        <br>and while you are sanding.
        <br>
        <br>Goggles and work gloves are also necessary sometimes to protect your hands from high temperatures and prevent anything from accidentally splashing 
        <br>into your eyes.
        <br>
        <br>8.Â <mark>Sandpaper</mark> - Sandpaper is an essential tool for getting a pristine finish to your cosplay props. Itâ€™s especially important for anything that you want to look 
        <br>like a blade (such as a sword, axe, etc.). However, sanding the seams of most props will do a lot to create a smooth overall look.
        <br>
        <br>Using plain old sandpaper is always an option, but you can also use a rotary sanding tool to speed up the process.Â I like to use a Dremel LiteÂ to sand my props
        <br> because it makes everything so much quicker and honestly looks better in the end.
        <br>
        <br>You can shape aluminum foil to create many the base layer for many different kinds of props.
        <br>
        <br>9. <mark>Foil or styrofoam</mark> - Aluminum foil andÂ styrofoamÂ are excellent tools to use as a base shape for your cosplay props. They are lightweight and easy to mold 
        <br>or cut into different shapes. I use these to create the general shape that Iâ€™m going for, then Iâ€™ll cover them with paper clay, EVA foam, or some other material 
        <br>to create the detailed shape. This prevents the final prop from being too dense and heavy, while also making it solid and less breakable.Â 
        <br>
        <br>You can use sheets of aluminum foil that you find at your supermarket and purchase styrofoam shapes at a craft store. If you need to use a lot of styrofoam, 
        <br>you can also buy large sheets of it.
        <br>
        <br>10.Â <mark>A large cutting board</mark>Â - I highly recommend getting a large self-healing cutting board to use for your prop-making journey. It will give you a large area 
        <br>to work on without worrying about ruining your table, floor, or cutting blade.
        <br>
        <br>However, a good cutting board can be pretty expensive. If itâ€™s not in your budget, you can flatten a cardboard box and place that underneath anything you 
        <br>are cutting, so you donâ€™t damage anything.</h5></p>

        <h3><mark>Cosplay</mark></h3>
        <h4>Cosplay, short for "costume play," is a performance art where participants, known as cosplayers, dress up in costumes and accessories to represent a specific 
            <br>character from anime, manga, video games, television shows, movies, or other forms of media. This vibrant and dynamic hobby transcends mere dressing up, 
            <br>incorporating elements of acting, crafting, and community engagement.</h4>
        <h3><mark>History and Evolution</mark></h3>
            <h4>The origins of cosplay can be traced back to the early science fiction conventions in the United States during the 1930s, where fans dressed up as 
            <br>characters from their favorite stories. However, the term "cosplay" itself was coined in Japan in the 1980s, derived from the words "costume" and "play." 
            <br>The practice rapidly gained popularity in Japan, particularly among anime and manga enthusiasts, before spreading globally.</h4>
        <h3><mark>The Art of Crafting</mark></h3>
        <h4>Creating a cosplay costume often involves significant effort and skill. Many cosplayers invest countless hours into sewing and constructing their outfits, 
            <br>using materials such as fabric, foam, and thermoplastics. Detailed prop-making is also a common aspect, with items like weapons, armor, and accessories  
            <br>being meticulously crafted to enhance the authenticity of the character portrayal. Some cosplayers even use advanced techniques such as 3D printing to 
            <br>achieve intricate designs.</h4>
        <h3><mark>Performance and Role-Playing</mark></h3>
            <h4>Beyond the costume itself, cosplay involves embodying the character's personality, mannerisms, and voice. This aspect of role-playing is a critical part of the 
            <br>experience, allowing cosplayers to fully immerse themselves in the character. During conventions and events, cosplayers often participate in skits, competitions, 
            <br>and photoshoots, showcasing their ability to bring fictional characters to life.</h4>
        <h3><mark>Community and Culture</mark></h3>
            <h4>Cosplay has fostered a global community of enthusiasts who share their passion for characters and craftsmanship. Conventions like Comic-Con, Anime Expo, 
            <br>and Cosplay Matsuri provide platforms for cosplayers to gather, exchange ideas, and celebrate their shared interests. Online communities and social media also 
            <br>play a significant role, allowing cosplayers to connect, share tutorials, and showcase their work to a broader audience.</h4>
        <h3><mark>Impact and Influence</mark></h3>
            <h4>Cosplay has significantly impacted popular culture and the entertainment industry. It has inspired fashion trends, influenced character design in media, and 
            <br>contributed to the growing acceptance of geek culture. Many professional cosplayers have turned their hobby into a career, gaining sponsorships, attending 
            <br>events worldwide, and building substantial followings on social media platforms.</h4>
        <h3><mark>Challenges and Rewards</mark></h3>
            <h4>While cosplay is a rewarding hobby, it also comes with challenges. The cost of materials, time investment, and the pressure to achieve high standards of accuracy 
            <br>can be daunting. Additionally, cosplayers sometimes face scrutiny and judgment from those outside the community. However, the sense of accomplishment, 
            <br>creative expression, and camaraderie among fellow enthusiasts often outweigh these challenges.</h4>
        <h3><mark>Conclusion</mark></h3>
            <h4>Cosplay is a multifaceted and inclusive hobby that combines creativity, performance, and community. It allows individuals to express their love for characters 
            <br>and stories uniquely and interactively. Whether through crafting intricate costumes, performing at conventions, or connecting with others online, cosplay 
            <br>continues to inspire and unite fans around the world.</h4>
